# Skin-Cancer-Detection
ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone!
I want to share with you my Skin Cancer Detection project, in collaboration with my colleague @serena111. It was an incredibly interesting and challenging project for us! ðŸ’ª

Using CNN neural networks, especially AlexNet, and MLP, we successfully conducted image classification of skin cancer lesions and predictive analysis to identify specific tumor types using dermatoscopic images. ðŸ’»
